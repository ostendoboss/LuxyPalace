        LuxyPalace specializes in high-end Jewelries, golds, diamonds, rubies, sapphire, pearls, necklaces, pendants, wedding rings, and bridal accessories that are not
        commonly found. We purchase small quantities of each item from an array of exclusive European designers. Many of our designers, only produce a limited quantity
        of each collection. Therefore, once a particular item is sold out, we are generally not able to reorder additional merchandise, depending upon the designer.
